## What is COMAND APS NTG4?
 
COMAND APS NTG4 is a navigation system that was introduced in 2007 for some Mercedes-Benz models, such as the C-Class (W204), the GLK (X204), and the SLS AMG (C197/R197). It features a 7-inch color display, a hard disk drive for music and navigation data, a DVD player, and voice control. It also supports Bluetooth, USB, AUX, SD card, and iPod/iPhone connectivity.
 
## What are the benefits of updating your maps?
 
Updating your maps can improve your navigation experience by providing you with more accurate and up-to-date information on roads, traffic, points of interest, and services. You can also enjoy new features and enhancements that may be included in the latest version of the software. For example, the 2018/2019 version of the DVD for Europe covers 40 countries and almost 8.5 million kilometers of road, with more than 2.6 million points of interest[^1^]. It also offers dynamic route guidance based on the latest traffic data (TMC/RDS) in 14 countries[^1^].
 
## How to get the DVD?
 
You can order the DVD online from various sources, such as the official Mercedes-Benz accessories website[^1^], authorized dealers[^2^], or third-party sellers[^3^]. The price may vary depending on the source and the region. The DVD has a color code of violet and an item number of A2048270800[^2^]. Make sure you get the correct DVD for your region and your system. You can check your system's compatibility by entering your vehicle identification number (VIN) on the website or by contacting the customer service.

## How to install the DVD?
 
Before you start the installation, make sure your vehicle is parked in a safe place with the engine running and the ignition switched on. You will also need to have your COMAND APS PIN code ready, which you can find in your user manual or on a card in your glove compartment. Follow these steps to install the DVD:
 
1. Eject any disc that may be in your COMAND APS unit and insert the first DVD of the update.
2. The system will automatically recognize the DVD and prompt you to enter your PIN code. Enter it using the numeric keypad on your unit.
3. The system will then ask you to confirm that you want to update your maps. Press OK to start the update.
4. The update process will take about 90 minutes. During this time, do not switch off the ignition, eject the DVD, or interrupt the power supply.
5. When the first DVD is finished, the system will prompt you to insert the second DVD. Eject the first DVD and insert the second one.
6. The system will continue the update process with the second DVD. This will take another 90 minutes.
7. When the second DVD is finished, the system will prompt you to eject it and restart your unit. Eject the second DVD and press OK to restart.
8. The update is now complete. You can check your map version by pressing NAVI and then SYSTEM on your unit.
