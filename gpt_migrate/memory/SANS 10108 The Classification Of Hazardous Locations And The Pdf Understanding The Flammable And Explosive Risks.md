# What You Need to Know About SANS 10108 and Hazardous Locations
  
If you work in an industry that involves flammable or explosive materials, you need to be aware of the standards and regulations that apply to your workplace. One of these standards is SANS 10108, which is a South African national standard for the classification of hazardous locations and the selection of apparatus for use in such locations.

SANS 10108 is a standard that provides guidelines for identifying and classifying hazardous locations based on the presence and properties of flammable gases, vapors, liquids, dusts, fibers or flyings. It also specifies the requirements for selecting, installing, operating and maintaining electrical equipment and wiring in these locations to prevent ignition and explosion hazards.
  
SANS 10108 is based on the international standards IEC 60079 and IEC 61241, which are widely used in other countries. It covers both gas and dust hazards, as well as hybrid mixtures of both. It also includes specific provisions for mines, petroleum refineries, chemical plants, grain silos and other common industrial settings.
  
What are hazardous locations?
  
Hazardous locations are areas where fire or explosion hazards may exist due to flammable gases or vapors, flammable liquids, combustible dust, or ignitable fibers or flyings. These materials can be ignited by sparks, arcs, flames, hot surfaces or static electricity generated by electrical equipment or wiring.

Hazardous locations are classified into three types according to the frequency and duration of the occurrence of flammable or explosive atmospheres:
  
- Type I: Locations where flammable or explosive atmospheres are present continuously or for long periods of time.
- Type II: Locations where flammable or explosive atmospheres are likely to occur under normal operating conditions.
- Type III: Locations where flammable or explosive atmospheres are not likely to occur under normal operating conditions, but may occur occasionally due to abnormal situations such as leaks or spills.

Each type of hazardous location is further divided into zones based on the probability of ignition and the severity of the consequences:

- Zone 0: Locations where an explosive gas atmosphere is present continuously or for long periods of time. This zone requires the highest level of protection for electrical equipment.
- Zone 1: Locations where an explosive gas atmosphere is likely to occur in normal operation. This zone requires a high level of protection for electrical equipment.
- Zone 2: Locations where an explosive gas atmosphere is not likely to occur in normal operation, but may occur for a short time due to abnormal conditions. This zone requires a moderate level of protection for electrical equipment.
- Zone 20: Locations where an explosive dust atmosphere is present continuously or for long periods of time. This zone requires the highest level of protection for electrical equipment.
- Zone 21: Locations where an explosive dust atmosphere is likely to occur in normal operation. This zone requires a high level of protection for electrical equipment.
- Zone 22: Locations where an explosive dust atmosphere is not likely to occur in normal operation, but may occur for a short time due to abnormal conditions. This zone requires a moderate level of protection for electrical equipment.

How to select apparatus for use in hazardous locations?
  
The selection of apparatus for use in hazardous locations depends on several factors, such as:

- The type, zone and group of the hazardous location.
- The temperature class and ignition energy of the flammable or explosive material.
- The protection method and marking of the electrical equipment.
- The installation and maintenance requirements of the electrical equipment.

SANS 10108 provides detailed guidance on how to select appropriate apparatus for each type of hazardous location. It also specifies the marking and labeling requirements for electrical equipment to indicate its suitability for use in hazardous locations. The marking should include information such as:

- The type and zone of the hazardous location (e.g., II 2 G).
- The group and category of the electrical equipment (e.g., Ex d IIB T4).
- The protection method and standard used (e.g., flameproof enclosure according to SANS/IEC 60079-1).
