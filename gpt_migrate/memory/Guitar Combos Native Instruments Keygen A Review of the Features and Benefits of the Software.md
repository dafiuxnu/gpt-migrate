## Choosing the Right Amp and Cabinet
 
The first step to creating your guitar tone is to choose the right amp and cabinet combination. Guitar Combos Native Instruments offers three different amps, each with its own matched cabinet. Here is a brief overview of each one:
 
- The AC Box Combo is based on a classic British combo amp from the 60s that is known for its warm and chimey sound. It has a simple layout with volume, bass, treble, and cut controls, as well as a boost switch for extra gain. It is ideal for clean and crunchy tones, especially for genres like pop, indie, or folk.
- The Plexi Combo is based on a legendary British stack amp from the late 60s that is famous for its powerful and aggressive sound. It has a two-channel design with volume, bass, middle, treble, and presence controls for each channel, as well as a bright switch for extra sparkle. It is perfect for rock and metal tones, especially for genres like hard rock, classic rock, or punk.
- The Twang Combo is based on a vintage American combo amp from the 50s that is renowned for its bright and twangy sound. It has a single-channel design with volume, bass, treble, reverb, and tremolo controls, as well as a fat switch for more low-end. It is great for country and blues tones, especially for genres like rockabilly, surf, or blues.

To choose the right amp and cabinet for your guitar tone, you can use the browser in Guitar Combos Native Instruments to browse through the presets or create your own. You can also use the A/B switch to compare two different settings and find the one you like best.

Guitar Combos Native Instruments offers a range of effects that can be added to your signal chain, such as distortion, compression, modulation, delay, and reverb.

To tweak the effects and settings of your guitar tone, you can use the knobs and switches on the interface of Guitar Combos Native Instruments to dial in your desired sound.
