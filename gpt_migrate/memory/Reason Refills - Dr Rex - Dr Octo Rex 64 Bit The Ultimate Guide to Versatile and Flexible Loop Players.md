Dr Rex is a loop player that can slice up any audio file into individual slices and play them back in sync with the tempo. You can also apply effects, filters, envelopes and modulation to each slice, as well as change the pitch and timing. Dr Rex can load any REX file, which is a special format that contains pre-sliced loops.
 
Dr Octo Rex is an upgraded version of Dr Rex that can load up to eight REX files at once and switch between them on the fly. You can also assign different outputs, filters and effects to each loop, as well as trigger them from a MIDI keyboard or sequencer. Dr Octo Rex gives you more flexibility and creative possibilities when working with loops.

Both Dr Rex and Dr Octo Rex are 64 bit compatible, which means they can handle larger files and use more memory than their 32 bit counterparts. However, some older Reason Refills may not work properly with the 64 bit versions of these devices. This is because they may contain 32 bit samples or patches that are not supported by the 64 bit engine. If you encounter any issues with loading or playing Reason Refills in 64 bit mode, here are some possible solutions:
 
- Update your Reason Refills to the latest version. Some Refills may have been updated to include 64 bit compatible samples or patches. You can check for updates on the official Propellerhead website or the website of the Refill manufacturer.
- Convert your Reason Refills to REX files. You can use a tool like ReCycle or REX Converter to convert any audio file into a REX file that can be loaded into Dr Rex or Dr Octo Rex. This way, you can avoid any compatibility issues with 32 bit samples or patches.
- Use a 32 bit bridge plugin. You can use a plugin like jBridge or 32 Lives to run 32 bit plugins in 64 bit mode. This way, you can load your Reason Refills into a 32 bit version of Dr Rex or Dr Octo Rex and use them as normal.

By following these tips, you should be able to use Reason Refills with Dr Rex and Dr Octo Rex in 64 bit mode without any problems.
