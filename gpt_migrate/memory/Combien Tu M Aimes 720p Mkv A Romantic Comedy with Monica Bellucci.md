How much do you love me? That's the question that FranÃ§ois, a lonely office worker who wins the lottery, asks Daniela, a stunning prostitute who works at a nightclub in Pigalle. He offers her 100,000 euros per month to live with him until his money runs out. But what starts as a fantasy soon becomes a complicated affair, as Daniela's pimp Charly, FranÃ§ois' heart condition, and their own feelings get in the way.

If you are looking for a quirky and unconventional comedy with a touch of eroticism and fantasy, you might enjoy Combien Tu M Aimes. It is not a typical romantic comedy, but rather a playful and whimsical exploration of human desires and emotions.
  
The movie has some interesting trivia that might appeal to the fans of the director and the actors. For example, Bertrand Blier wrote the script with Monica Bellucci in mind, and she accepted the role without reading it. She said she was attracted by the challenge of playing a prostitute who falls in love with a simple man. She also said she enjoyed working with Blier, who gave her a lot of freedom and confidence.

GÃ©rard Depardieu, who plays the menacing but humorous Charly, had previously worked with Blier in several films, such as Going Places (1974), Get Out Your Handkerchiefs (1978), Too Beautiful for You (1989), and My Man (1996). He said he liked Blier's style of writing and directing, which he described as "poetic and crazy". He also praised Bellucci's performance and beauty, saying she was "a goddess". [^1^]
 
The movie was shot mostly in Paris, especially in the Pigalle district, which is known for its nightlife and sex industry. The nightclub where Daniela works is called Le Sphinx, and it is a real cabaret that features erotic shows. The movie also features some scenes in Rome, where Daniela and FranÃ§ois go on a trip. The movie has a soundtrack composed by Nicola Piovani, who won an Oscar for his score for Life Is Beautiful (1997). The movie also includes songs by Serge Gainsbourg, Charles Aznavour, and Dalida.

The movie received mixed reviews from critics and audiences, who praised its originality and charm, but also criticized its lack of coherence and depth. Some critics found the movie to be a witty and whimsical exploration of human desires and emotions, while others found it to be a shallow and vulgar exercise in bad taste. Some critics also noted the influence of other directors, such as Luis BuÃ±uel, Federico Fellini, and Woody Allen, on Blier's style and themes. [^1^]
 
The movie was a moderate success at the box office, grossing $6.8 million worldwide on a budget of $11.4 million.  It was nominated for two CÃ©sar Awards, for Best Supporting Actor (Jean-Pierre Darroussin) and Best Original Screenplay (Bertrand Blier). It also won the Silver George for Best Director at the 28th Moscow International Film Festival.
