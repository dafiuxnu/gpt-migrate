Split Second is not just a typical racing game, but a game that offers unique features that make it stand out from the crowd. Here are some of the features that you can enjoy in Split Second:

- Power Plays: These are the main attraction of the game, as they allow you to trigger explosive events that can change the course of the race or eliminate your rivals. You can activate power plays by filling up your meter with stunts and precision driving, and then timing them right to cause maximum damage. Power plays come in two levels: level one events are less destructive but more frequent, while level two events are more devastating but require a full meter. You can also trigger power plays that affect only you, such as opening shortcuts or boosting your speed.
- Game Modes: Split Second offers a variety of game modes to suit your preferences and skills. The main mode is the Season mode, where you compete in 12 episodes of the TV show, each consisting of several events. You can earn credits and trophies by finishing in the top three positions, which unlock new cars and tracks. You can also play Quick Play mode, where you can choose any event and track that you have unlocked, and customize the settings such as difficulty and number of opponents. For multiplayer fans, there is the Split Screen mode, where you can race against a friend on the same screen, and the Online mode, where you can join or host races with up to eight players online.
- Cars and Tracks: Split Second features a wide range of cars and tracks to choose from, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. The cars are divided into four classes: Elite, Muscle, Sports, and Tuner. Each class has different attributes such as speed, acceleration, handling, and drift. You can also customize your car's color and decals to suit your style. The tracks are based on various locations such as airports, docks, power plants, and downtown areas. Each track has multiple routes and power play opportunities that make every race different and unpredictable.
