## Historical musical influences
 
Balkan music has been shaped by various historical influences, such as Byzantine, Ottoman, Greek, and Western European cultures. Each of these influences has left its mark on the musical traditions of the region, creating a rich and diverse musical heritage.
 
### Byzantine medieval music
 
Byzantine music is the sacred chant of the Christian churches that followed the Constantinopolitan rite. It is based on the ancient Greek modal system, and developed large-scale hymnographic forms in the fifth and sixth centuries. Byzantine music was widely spread across the Balkans, especially among the Orthodox communities, and influenced the development of local liturgical and folk music.[^1^]
 
### Greek music
 
Greek music is one of the oldest and most influential musical traditions in Europe. It traces its roots to the ancient Greek civilization, which produced many forms of music, such as epic poetry, lyric poetry, drama, philosophy, and science. Greek music also absorbed elements from other cultures, such as Persian, Egyptian, Roman, and Arabic. In the modern era, Greek music has been influenced by Western classical music, as well as by popular genres such as rebetiko, laiko, entekhno, and skyladiko.[^2^]
 
### Ottoman music
 
Ottoman music is the art music of the Ottoman Empire, which spanned over six centuries and three continents. It is based on a complex system of modes (makam), rhythms (usul), and forms (saz semai, pesrev, etc.). Ottoman music was performed by professional musicians (fasil) in various settings, such as palaces, courts, mosques, taverns, and coffeehouses. Ottoman music had a profound impact on the musical cultures of the Balkans, especially among the Muslim and Jewish communities, and influenced the urban traditions of makam-based music.[^3^]
