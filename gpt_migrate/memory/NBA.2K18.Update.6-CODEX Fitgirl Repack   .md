NBA 2K18 also features several new and improved gameplay features that make the game more realistic and enjoyable. For example, the game introduces more realistic player movement, improved colors and better-looking players, improved shooting and passing controls, new loose ball physics, defensive chatter and coordination, and system proficiency for coaches[^1^]. These features aim to enhance the immersion and realism of the game, as well as provide more options and strategies for the players.
 
Another new feature of NBA 2K18 is MyGM: The Next Chapter, a new mode that expands the scope of the team-managing MyGM mode. In this mode, the player assumes the role of a former NBA player who becomes the general manager of an NBA team. The mode features a storyline that plays out through cutscenes and interactions with other characters, as well as decision-making scenarios that affect the team's performance and reputation. The mode also allows the player to customize various aspects of their team, such as the arena, the jerseys, the logos, and the staff[^2^].
 
One of the most innovative features of NBA 2K18 is The Neighborhood, a new social hub that integrates several game modes into one open-world environment. The Neighborhood allows the player to explore a city-like area and interact with other players and NPCs. The player can also access various activities and facilities, such as shops, gyms, courts, and arenas. The Neighborhood serves as a central hub for MyCareer, MyPark, Pro-Am, and MyTeam modes[^2^]. The player can use their custom-created player to participate in these modes and earn rewards such as virtual currency (VC), experience points (XP), badges, and clothing items.
