You can also improve your productivity and efficiency by working with multiple computers simultaneously. ShareMouse is compatible with Windows, Mac, and Linux operating systems, and supports different screen resolutions and orientations.

For example, ShareMouse may not work well with some applications or games that require exclusive access to the mouse or keyboard. ShareMouse may also experience some lag or glitches if your network connection is slow or unstable. Moreover, ShareMouse is not free and requires a license key to unlock its full features.
