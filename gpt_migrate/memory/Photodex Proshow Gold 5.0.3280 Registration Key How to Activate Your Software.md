In this article, we will show you how to activate Photodex Proshow Gold 5.0.3280 without server connection by replacing three .dnt files in the installation directory. This method will bypass the registration key requirement and let you use the software without any limitations.

## Step 1: Download the three .dnt files
 
The first step is to download the three .dnt files that will replace the original ones in the installation directory of Photodex Proshow Gold 5.0.3280.

Save the zip file to your computer and extract it to a folder of your choice.
 
## Step 2: Rename and replace the original .dnt files

## Tips for publishing your shows
 
If you want to publish your shows to your computer or external drive, you should avoid using online options such as "Video for Web, Devices and Computers", "Publish Show", "YouTube", "Facebook" or other online options. These options may not work because they require a connection to Photodex's server, which may not have your customer data transferred or may not be in operation at all.
 
Instead, you should use the "For Computers" option under the Publish menu or tab. Then, select "Custom Video File" and choose your preferred type, quality and aspect ratio for your video file. Click on "Create" and wait for your show to be rendered
