- One option is to use a torrent client like uTorrent to download the movie file from a torrent site. However, this method is illegal and risky, as you may encounter viruses, malware, or legal issues. You also need a good internet connection and enough storage space on your device.
- Another option is to use a streaming site that offers free movies online. However, these sites are also illegal and unreliable, as they may have low-quality videos, annoying ads, pop-ups, or redirects. You also need to be careful about your online privacy and security when using these sites.
- A better option is to use a legitimate streaming service that offers a free trial or a free plan. For example, you can watch The Boss Baby on Netflix with a 30-day free trial, or on Peacock with a 7-day free trial or a free plan with ads. You just need to sign up with your email and credit card information, and cancel before the trial ends if you don't want to pay. You can also watch The Boss Baby on other streaming services like Amazon Prime Video, Hulu, Disney+, or YouTube, but you may need to pay extra for renting or buying the movie.

Whichever option you choose, make sure you have a compatible device and a stable internet connection to enjoy watching The Boss Baby online for free.

If you enjoyed watching The Boss Baby online for free, you might be interested in its sequel, The Boss Baby: Family Business, which was released in 2021. This film follows the now-adult Templeton brothers who are brought back together by Tim's daughter Tina, another secret agent from Baby Corp. Their mission is to stop a sinister plot by Dr. Armstrong, the founder and principal of a prestigious school for gifted children. To do so, they have to drink a special formula that turns them back into kids for 48 hours.
 
The Boss Baby: Family Business features the voices of Alec Baldwin, James Marsden, Amy Sedaris, Ariana Greenblatt, Jeff Goldblum, Eva Longoria, Jimmy Kimmel, and Lisa Kudrow. It is directed by Tom McGrath and written by Michael McCullers. The film received mixed reviews from critics and audiences, but was praised for its animation and voice performances. It grossed $146 million worldwide against its $82 million budget.
 
You can watch The Boss Baby: Family Business on Peacock with a paid subscription or a free plan with ads. You can also rent or buy it on other streaming services like Amazon Prime Video, YouTube, Google Play Movies & TV, Apple TV, Vudu, or Fandango Now. However, you may need to pay extra fees depending on your location and device.
 
Alternatively, you can wait for the film to be available on Netflix sometime in 2022. Netflix has a deal with DreamWorks Animation to stream their films after their theatrical release. In the meantime, you can watch the Netflix original series The Boss Baby: Back in Business and The Boss Baby: Back in the Crib, which are spin-offs of the films and feature different voice actors and stories.
